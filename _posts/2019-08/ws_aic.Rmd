Just a quick note to say that many workshops are on the way in the fall, so keep an eye out on [our calendar](https://cscar.research.umich.edu/events/category/workshops/).  Also, added a link to [our FAQ](https://cscar.github.io/statistics.html#miscellaneousfrequently-asked-questions) regarding model comparison.  How low does AIC have to be before accepting a model?
