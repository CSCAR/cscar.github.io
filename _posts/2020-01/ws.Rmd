Take a look [our calendar](https://cscar.research.umich.edu/events/category/workshops/) for upcoming workshops.  The R series is underway, as well as the R by Example collection of talks.   Director Kerby Shedden outlines methodological approaches for Python, and we've given other workshops on Deep Learning, Julia, and more!

Aside from that, you may also be interested in the [U-M Staff Data Scientists Meet-Up](https://midas.umich.edu/event/u-m-staff-data-scientists-meet-up/) and talks of the [MIDAS Seminar Series](https://midas.umich.edu/seminar-series/).

We've also added a couple resources to our R, Stata, and SPSS pages.
