[Andrew Hylnka](https://github.com/hlynka-a) <img style='vertical-align:middle; width: 20px' src='https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1075461?s=400&v=4' >

Andrew is a research applications developer with a background in artificial intelligence, interactive multimedia and animation. Specific experience includes use of programming languages including C# and Java, research with agent-modeling, Android app development with Android SDK, and game development with popular game engines including Unity3D and Unreal. He can assist with computer programming, agent-based simulation design, and understanding available tools for developing interactive applications or 3D visualizations.


[Kerby Shedden](https://github.com/kshedden) &nbsp; <img style='vertical-align:middle; width: 20px' src='https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2666691?v=3&s=400' >

Kerby has collaborated with researchers in many areas of natural and social science, with a particular focus on studies involving high dimensional biological data, including genomics, biological imaging, statistical genetics, chemical informatics, health outcomes, and medical claims data. He also has extensive experience in software development, primarily in Python and Go.  His research focuses on computational statistics, and methods for modeling complex dependent data including multilevel, longitudinal, and spatial/temporal data.

[Gregory Teichert]() &nbsp; Greg is a computational science applications specialist with a background in computational materials science. He has developed scientific software in C++ for modeling solid mechanics and phase field dynamics in materials, using the finite element method. He has experience with the computational libraries PETSc, Trilinos, deal.II, and PetIGA. His research has involved using machine learning techniques, including deep neural networks and the TensorFlow library, to learn free energy surfaces to predict material microstructure.

[Marcio Mourao](https://github.com/marcio-mourao) &nbsp; <img style='vertical-align:middle; width: 20px' src='https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/20603743?v=3&s=400' >  

Márcio’s PhD degree was obtained in partnership with the PhD Program in Computational Biology (PDBC) at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC).  As part of his PhD specialization in complex systems, he wrote his thesis on “reverse engineering the mechanisms and the dynamical behavior of complex biochemical pathways”. Márcio has taught courses for Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics departments, including MatLab, Calculus and Mathematical Biology. As a mathematical/computational biologist, he has worked on numerous interdisciplinary problems, mostly focused in chemistry, biology and physiology. He has particular expertise in the development and analysis of dynamical systems, primarily using differential equations, and in the development of agent-based models and stochastic simulations.
