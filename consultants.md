The following is a list of the consultants who are active on [GitHub](https://github.com/CSCAR) with links to their GitHub presence.  For a list of **all** consultants see the [main CSCAR website](http://cscar.research.umich.edu/about/).

[Alex Cao](https://github.com/caocscar) &nbsp; <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src='https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14318360?v=3&s=400' width=20px> 

Alex has more than 14 years of research experience in projects involving medical devices, surgical simulation, human factors testing, tele-operated robotics, Raman spectroscopy, and condition-based maintenance for military helicopters. He has worked for several academic institutions, an aerospace company, a start-up medical device company, and with NASA.


[Michael Clark](https://github.com/m-clark) &nbsp; <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src='https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4720569?v=3&s=400' width=20px>

Michael has modeling and consulting experience across varied domains, including social and physical sciences, business, and humanities. He has particular expertise in mixed models, additive models, latent variable models, text analysis, structural equations modeling, machine learning techniques, Bayesian inference, reproducible research practices, data visualization, and efficient programming practices.

[Josh Errickson](https://github.com/josherrickson) &nbsp; <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src='https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1674171?v=3&s=400' width=20px>

Josh has academic degrees in both Statistics and Computer Science, with deep experience in statistical methodology and use of statistical software. His areas of interest include causal inference, propensity score matching, multiple regression diagnosis, structural equation modeling, software implementation and general computing concerns.


[James Henderson](https://github.com/jbhender) &nbsp; <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src='https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14826537?v=3&s=400' width=20px>

James has provided statistical expertise to a variety of projects, particularly in biomedical domains. While a post-doc at the UM Cancer Center, he extensively used advanced bioinformatic and statistical tools for large-scale data analyses.  His research interests include structure learning for biological networks, especially from perturbation or time-series data, and enrichment analysis.  Other areas of expertise include: regression modeling, graphical models, high performance computing, inter-rater reliability, and parameter estimation for dynamic systems.


[Marcio Mourao](https://github.com/marcio-mourao) &nbsp; <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src='https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/20603743?v=3&s=400' width=20px>

Márcio’s PhD degree was obtained in partnership with the PhD Program in Computational Biology (PDBC) at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC).  As part of his PhD specialization in complex systems, he wrote his thesis on “reverse engineering the mechanisms and the dynamical behavior of complex biochemical pathways”. Márcio has taught courses for Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics departments, including MatLab, Calculus and Mathematical Biology. As a mathematical/computational biologist, he has worked on numerous interdisciplinary problems, mostly focused in chemistry, biology and physiology. He has particular expertise in the development and analysis of dynamical systems, primarily using differential equations, and in the development of agent-based models and stochastic simulations.

[Kerby Shedden](https://github.com/kshedden) &nbsp; <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src='https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2666691?v=3&s=400' width=20px>

Kerby has collaborated with researchers in many areas of natural and social science, with a particular focus on studies involving high dimensional biological data, including genomics, biological imaging, statistical genetics, chemical informatics, health outcomes, and medical claims data. He also has extensive experience in software development, primarily in Python and Go.  His research focuses on computational statistics, and methods for modeling complex dependent data including multilevel, longitudinal, and spatial/temporal data.
