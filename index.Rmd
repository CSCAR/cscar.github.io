[CSCAR](http://cscar.research.umich.edu/), or Consulting for Statistics, Computation, & Analytics Research, is the consulting arm of the [Advanced Research Computing](http://arc.umich.edu/) group at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/).  CSCAR provides consulting services and training opportunities in data science, statistics, and advanced research computation.  For more information about CSCAR visit the website.

This site is used for CSCAR resources, especially those geared toward helping collaborators and clients learn new tools for research.  It will house content primarily related to workshops, but also other things we might find useful to ourselves or our clients, and will be updated regularly.

# Workshops

CSCAR does a lot of [workshops](http://cscar.research.umich.edu/events/category/workshops/). Like, *really* a lot. This is where you can find web pages/sites of CSCAR members that specifically house materials for workshops, like slides, code etc.  Listed are the primary programming languages covered.


[Michael Clark](https://m-clark.github.io/workshops/) R, Stan

[Marcio Mourao](https://marcio-mourao.github.io/) Python, Matlab

[Kerby Shedden](https://kshedden.github.io/) Python, Go


## Data Science Skills Series

We conduct the *Data Science Skills Series*, which are typically two-hour free worskhops on any number of topics. Here are some of the topics that have been covered or soon will be.

### R

Data Processing and Visualization, Engaging the Web, Generalized Additive Models, tidyverse, Bayesian modeling with R & Stan, Getting more from RStudio, Parallel Computing, Dimension Reduction techniques, Intro to Rcpp, Developing R packages


### Python

Data Processing and Visualization, Unsupervised Learning,  Supervised Learning, Regular Expressions, Engaging the Web, Mixed Models, GEE, Multiple imputation and missing data methods, Mediation analysis, GeoPandas, Network Analysis, Numpy


### Matlab

Introduction to Matlab, Intermediate Matlab

### Other

GIS and spatial analysis, Introduction to GO, Intermediate GO. Note that ARC-TS (the high performance computing group) provides workshops specific to working with their environment (e.g. cluster computing).



## Traditional Workshops

CSCAR  gives paid for workshops that are longer lasting, often taking place over multiple full or half days, and definitely hands on.    The following is a list of topics covered.

Introduction to Statistical Analysis in R

Several introductions to statisital packages: SAS, SPSS, Stata

Mixed Models in SPSS

Introduction to survey design

Structural Equation Modeling (3 part series including graphical modeling, latent variables, and SEM)





# Resources

Here are various resources we think people we work with might find useful. Topics regard specific programming languages, statistical techniques etc.
