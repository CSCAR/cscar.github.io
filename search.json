For a list of all consultants see the main CSCAR website.\n\nAlex Cao   \nAlex has more than 14 years of research experience in projects involving medical devices, surgical simulation, human factors testing, tele-operated robotics, Raman spectroscopy, and condition-based maintenance for military helicopters. He has worked for several academic institutions, an aerospace company, a start-up medical device company, and with NASA. \nMichael Clark   \nMichael has modeling and consulting experience across varied domains, including social and physical sciences, business, and humanities. He has particular expertise in mixed models, additive models, latent variable models, text analysis, structural equation modeling, machine learning techniques, Bayesian inference, reproducible research practices, data visualization, and efficient programming practices. \nJosh Errickson   \nJosh has academic degrees in both Statistics and Computer Science, with deep experience in statistical methodology and use of statistical software. His areas of interest include causal inference, propensity score matching, multiple regression diagnosis, structural equation modeling, software implementation and general computing concerns. \nJames Henderson   \nJames has provided statistical expertise to a variety of projects, particularly in biomedical domains. While a post-doc at the UM Cancer Center, he extensively used advanced bioinformatic and statistical tools for large-scale data analyses. His research interests include structure learning for biological networks, especially from perturbation or time-series data, and enrichment analysis. Other areas of expertise include: regression modeling, graphical models, high performance computing, inter-rater reliability, and parameter estimation for dynamic systems. \nAndrew Hylnka \nAndrew is a research applications developer with a background in artificial intelligence, interactive multimedia and animation. Specific experience includes use of programming languages including C# and Java, research with agent-modeling, Android app development with Android SDK, and game development with popular game engines including Unity3D and Unreal. He can assist with computer programming, agent-based simulation design, and understanding available tools for developing interactive applications or 3D visualizations.\nKerby Shedden   \nKerby has collaborated with researchers in many areas of natural and social science, with a particular focus on studies involving high dimensional biological data, including genomics, biological imaging, statistical genetics, chemical informatics, health outcomes, and medical claims data. He also has extensive experience in software development, primarily in Python and Go. His research focuses on computational statistics, and methods for modeling complex dependent data including multilevel, longitudinal, and spatial/temporal data.\nGregory Teichert   \nGreg is a computational science applications specialist with a background in computational materials science. He has developed scientific software in C++ for modeling solid mechanics and phase field dynamics in materials, using the finite element method. He has experience with the computational libraries PETSc, Trilinos, deal.II, and PetIGA. His research has involved using machine learning techniques, including deep neural networks and the TensorFlow library, to learn free energy surfaces to predict material microstructure.\n\nFormer Consultants:\nMarcio Mourao   \nMárcio’s PhD degree was obtained in partnership with the PhD Program in Computational Biology (PDBC) at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC). As part of his PhD specialization in complex systems, he wrote his thesis on “reverse engineering the mechanisms and the dynamical behavior of complex biochemical pathways”. Márcio has taught courses for Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics departments, including MatLab, Calculus and Mathematical Biology. As a mathematical/computational biologist, he has worked on numerous interdisciplinary problems, mostly focused in chemistry, biology and physiology. He has particular expertise in the development and analysis of dynamical systems, primarily using differential equations, and in the development of agent-based models and stochastic simulations. \n\n\n\n",
