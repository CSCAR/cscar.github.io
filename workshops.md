CSCAR does a lot of [workshops](http://cscar.research.umich.edu/events/category/workshops/). Like, *really* a lot. This is where you can find web pages/sites of CSCAR members that specifically house materials for workshops, like slides, code etc.  Listed are the primary programming languages covered.

## Data Science Skills Series

We conduct the *Data Science Skills Series*, which are typically two-hour free workshops on any number of topics. Here are some of the topics that have been covered or soon will be.

### R

Data Processing and Visualization, Engaging the Web, Generalized Additive Models, tidyverse, Bayesian modeling with R & Stan, Getting more from RStudio, Parallel Computing, Dimension Reduction techniques, Intro to Rcpp, Developing R packages


### Python

Data Processing and Visualization, Unsupervised Learning,  Supervised Learning, Regular Expressions, Engaging the Web, Mixed Models, GEE, Multiple imputation and missing data methods, Mediation analysis, GeoPandas, Network Analysis, Numpy


### Matlab

Introduction to Matlab, Intermediate Matlab

### Other

GIS and spatial analysis, Introduction to GO, Intermediate GO. Note that ARC-TS (the high performance computing group) provides workshops specific to working with their environment (e.g. cluster computing).



## Traditional Workshops

CSCAR  gives paid for workshops that are longer lasting, often taking place over multiple full or half days, and definitely hands on.    The following is a list of topics covered.

Introduction to Statistical Analysis in R

Several introductions to statistical packages: SAS, SPSS, Stata

Mixed Models in SPSS

Introduction to survey design

Structural Equation Modeling (3 part series including graphical modeling, latent variables, and SEM)
